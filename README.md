process stats --pid 1234 --output json
```

## Advanced Features

```python
# Monitor process with callback
def resource_alert(process):
    if process.cpu > 90:
        print(f"High CPU usage: {process.cpu}%")

pm.monitor(pid=1234, callback=resource_alert, interval=5)

# Process tree visualization
pm.print_process_tree(root_pid=1)
```
